            Classes in this academy are of 6 divisions (Level 1 to 6). Students
            who fall into each of the levels has a set of books they would have
            to finish before moving to another level to ensure the basics are
            well taught and the intended strong foundations are well built.
            These books are taken one after the other, not like 2 or 3 or 4 at a
            time (i.e when a book from the list for a particular class is not
            finished, another won&apos;t be taken)
